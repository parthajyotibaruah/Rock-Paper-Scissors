# Rock-Paper-Scissors

<strong>DEMO:</strong> https://parthajyotibaruah.github.io/Rock-Paper-Scissors/ 

A Javascript project from The Odin Project's <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/rock-paper-scissors">curriculum</a>.

<strong>Update:</strong><br> 
After learning DOM manipulation, added a simple UI so the game can be played by clicking buttons instead of typing answers in prompt.

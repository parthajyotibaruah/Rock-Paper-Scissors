# Rock-Paper-Scissors
A Javascript project from The Odin Project's <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/rock-paper-scissors">curriculum</a>.

Update: 
After learning DOM manipulation, added a simple UI so the game can be played by clicking buttons instead of typing answers in prompt.
